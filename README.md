# README

My first CRUD App with Ruby on Rails.

In App i build friends-list with options: add, edit, delete, show (CRUD).

App is inspired by Ruby on Rails course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg

CSS styles supported by Bootstrap 5.

Reasons of use Rails:

- CRUD functionality

- MVC architecture

- Scaffold model

- easey to build and use database (sqlite3)
